/** \brief Checks the track to see if a corner can be detected.
 * 
 * The detector chooses an anchor point, then looks forward in time to an end vector,
 * and backward in time to a start vector. If the start and end vectors are separated
 * (relative to the anchor) by an angle of more than detection_angle, a corner is
 * detected. The detector will then step the end point backward, and the start point
 * forward, in order to localise the point as much as possible. When it has been localized
 * the detector returns true, and the calling code can then access detection_location
 * if they need to know the location of the corner.
 * 
 * Window size and call frequency are related. If, for example, you want to look at five
 * second slices of the track, then (window_size, call_frequency) could be paired as, e.g.
 *      (11, 500 ms)
 * This means the update function should be called every 500 ms and will keep the 11 most
 * recent position updates (assuming appropriate separation). This corresponds roughly to
 * five seconds of travel time. We use a window size of 11 rather than to guarantee that
 * there will always be a centre index. Odd number window sizes are to be preferred for
 * this reason, though the detector will function regardless.
 *      Something like (3, 5 ms) would be an unsuitable usage pattern as no meaningful
 * human motion takes place over the course of 15 ms.
 * 
 * \param position The most recent known position.
 * \return Boolean flag indiciated whether a corner was detected or not.
